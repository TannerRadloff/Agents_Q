**# Betrayal**

**Stanza 1: Introduction to Betrayal**

In the garden where whispers grew,  
Beneath the moonâ€™s watchful eye,  
Two shadows danced, cloaked in trust,  
In their silence, betrayal began to sigh.

**Stanza 2: Emotional Unraveling**

Anger storms like a wild sea,  
Raging against the brittle shore,  
From anger's storm to sorrow's veil,  
Doubt creeps in, a silent tale.  
Trust shattered like glass in the night,  
Innocence lost to echoes of deceit,  
A tapestry of lies, woven tight,  
Leaves the heart in bitter retreat.

**Stanza 3: Reflection**

Once, laughter wove through golden days,  
Now shadows stretch, warmth in dismay.  
In the mirror of memory, reflections dance,  
Echoes of a love that seemed so true,  
Yet beneath the surface, a hollow glance,  
Reveals the cracks that slowly grew.

**Stanza 4: Resolution**

Yet as the night gives way to dawn,  
From memories' dance to morning's light,  
New strength emerges from the night.  
Acceptance, a gentle balm,  
Whispers of healing, soft and slow,  
Empowerment in the calm,  
A testament to the heart's enduring glow.

**Concluding Couplet:**

From betrayal's shadow, light is drawn,  
A new dawn rises, hope reborn.
