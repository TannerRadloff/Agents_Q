Root Cause Analysis and Fix for the Agents_Q Application

ISSUE SUMMARY:
--------------
The application was failing with a BadRequestError when trying to use the OpenAI Responses API
with structured outputs (Pydantic models). The specific error was:

"Invalid schema for response_format 'final_output': In context=('properties', 'status'), 
'default' is not permitted."

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The OpenAI Responses API doesn't allow default values in the JSON schema when using 
structured outputs. Our models had default values for fields like `status`, which caused 
the validation error.

FIX:
----
1. Update app/models.py to remove default values:
   - Change `status: str = "pending"` to `status: Optional[str] = None`
   - Change `references: List[str] = []` to `references: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)`
   - Change `status: str = "created"` to `status: Optional[str] = None`
   - Change `context: Dict[str, Any] = {}` to `context: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)`

2. Add any necessary initialization in the code that creates these objects.

TESTING:
--------
The fix has been tested with a simplified script (models_test.py) that confirmed the Responses API
now accepts our models without the default values.

NOTES:
------
- This issue only affected the interaction with the OpenAI Responses API
- The API works fine with regular Chat Completions
- The issue wasn't a network connectivity problem as initially suspected

To apply this fix:
1. Update app/models.py as described above
2. Initialize model values where needed in the code
3. Restart the application
